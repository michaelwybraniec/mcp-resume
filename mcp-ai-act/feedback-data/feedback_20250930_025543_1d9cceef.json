Let me walk you through what I found:\n\nüî¥ **Your system is classified as HIGH RISK**\nThis means you'll need to implement comprehensive compliance measures before you can deploy in the EU. Don't worry - I'll guide you through exactly what you need to do!\n\n**My confidence in this assessment:** 100.0%\n**Key AI Act articles that apply:** Article 5, Article 10, Article 12, Article 8, Article 6...\n\nüìÅ **I also analyzed your project directory and found:**\nüìÅ **Project Directory Analysis:** /Users/michaelwybraniec/Documents/GitHub/mcp-resume\nüìÑ **Key Files Found:** README.md, requirements.txt, app.py\nü§ñ **AI/ML Related Files:** core/models.py, venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/httpcore/_models.py, venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/streamlit/__main__.py, venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/dotenv/main.py, venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/dotenv/__main__.py\nüìä **Data Files:** venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/tornado/test/csv_translations/fr_FR.csv, venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/numpy/random/tests/data/philox-testset-1.csv, venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/numpy/random/tests/data/philox-testset-2.csv, venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/numpy/random/tests/data/sfc64-testset-1.csv, venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/numpy/random/tests/data/sfc64-testset-2.csv\nüìö **Documentation:** DEPLOYMENT.md, AI_ACT_COMPLIANCE.md, agentic-sdlc/AWP.md, agentic-sdlc/commitStandard.md, agentic-sdlc/ASDLC.md\n\nüìã **Here are the main compliance requirements you need to address:**\n1. Risk management system implementation\n2. Record keeping\n3. Compliance with applicable requirements\n4. Technical documentation\n5. Data governance and quality management\n... and 3 more requirements (see detailed report)\n\n‚ùì **To give you more specific guidance, I'd like to ask you a few questions:**\n\n**For High-Risk Systems, I need to understand:**\n\n1. **What personal data does your system process?**\n   (e.g., names, emails, biometric data, health information)\n\n2. **How much influence does your AI have on decisions?**\n   (Is it just advisory, or does it make final decisions?)\n\n3. **What human oversight do you currently have?**\n   (Can humans review or override AI decisions?)\n\n4. **Do you have any existing risk management procedures?**\n   (Risk assessments, monitoring, incident response)\n\n5. **What technical documentation do you have?**\n   (System architecture, algorithms, limitations)\n\nüí° **Here's what I recommend you do next:**\n\nüî¥ **HIGH PRIORITY - You need comprehensive compliance measures:**\n\n**Immediate actions (this week):**\n‚Ä¢ Add clear AI transparency notices\n‚Ä¢ Implement basic human oversight\n‚Ä¢ Start documenting your system\n\n**Medium-term actions (next month):**\n‚Ä¢ Develop risk management procedures\n‚Ä¢ Create technical documentation\n‚Ä¢ Implement data governance\n\n**Long-term actions (next 3 months):**\n‚Ä¢ Prepare for conformity assessment\n‚Ä¢ Implement monitoring systems\n‚Ä¢ Create audit procedures\n\nüìÅ **I've saved detailed reports for you**\n\n**Files created in your project directory:**\n‚Ä¢ **Reports:** `mcp-ai-act/session-<timestamp>/report-analysis/`\n‚Ä¢ **Migration Strategy:** `mcp-ai-act/migration-strategy/awp/`\n‚Ä¢ **Feedback Data:** `mcp-ai-act/feedback-data/`\n\nCheck these files for comprehensive analysis and step-by-step implementation guides.\n\nüìä **I'm also tracking our conversation**\nThis helps me improve and provide better guidance in the future.\n\n**Ready to answer my questions above?
